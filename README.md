Easy
Write a function that will take two numbers, calculate the sum of all numbers between them (inclusive), and divide that sum by the sum of the two entered numbers.

Example:
For the numbers 4 and 10:

Calculate the sum of all numbers between 4 and 10:

4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 49

Divide this sum by the sum of the two entered numbers:

49 / 4 + 10

The result will be:

3.5
