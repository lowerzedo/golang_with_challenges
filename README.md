---

### Example

For the numbers **4** and **10**:

1. Calculate the sum of all numbers between 4 and 10:

   ```
   4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 49
   ```

2. Divide this sum by the sum of the two entered numbers:

   ```
   49 / (4 + 10)
   ```

3. The result will be:

   ```
   3.5
   ```

### Usage

To run the function, execute the `main.go` file:

```sh
go run
```
